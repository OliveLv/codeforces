/**
 * During the break the schoolchildren, boys and girls, formed a queue of n
 * people in the canteen. Initially the children stood in the order they entered
 * the canteen. However, after a while the boys started feeling awkward for
 * standing in front of the girls in the queue and they started letting the
 * girls move forward each second.
 * 
 * Let's describe the process more precisely. Let's say that the positions in
 * the queue are sequentially numbered by integers from 1 to n, at that the
 * person in the position number 1 is served first. Then, if at time x a boy
 * stands on the i-th position and a girl stands on the (i + 1)-th position,
 * then at time x + 1 the i-th position will have a girl and the (i + 1)-th
 * position will have a boy. The time is given in seconds.
 * 
 * You've got the initial position of the children, at the initial moment of
 * time. Determine the way the queue is going to look after t seconds.
 * 
 * Input 
 * The first line contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n, t ≤ 50), which
 * represent the number of children in the queue and the time after which the
 * queue will transform into the arrangement you need to find.
 * 
 * The next line contains string s, which represents the schoolchildren's
 * initial arrangement. If the i-th position in the queue contains a boy, then
 * the i-th character of string s equals "B", otherwise the i-th character
 * equals "G".
 * 
 * Output 
 * Print string a, which describes the arrangement after t seconds. If
 * the i-th position has a boy after the needed time, then the i-th character a
 * must equal "B", otherwise it must equal "G".
 *
